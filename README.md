# Refer
Refer provides employers with a platform to set key goals with employees allowing them to improve their employment rating score.
I recently got this project fom a client who wants to help me be to pay my tuition fees, however, this project is quiet complex for me as  I am not familiar with backend yet. 

Refer should be accessed by three different parties, the company, employee and next employer who wnants to verify the employees performance review form the previous company. 
Refer will make use of databses, which is something I am still learning.

The company will only be able to edit and sumbit the performance of an employee.
The employee should be able to login in the system and view the performance reveiw and be able to submit additional acheivements.(company will check if they are correct)


the next employer will get consent from the employee to acesss the system to verify the review. They should be able to use an unique code/employee code to pull up their details.


the performance review will be a in form of star rating system(shuould be easy to upate and additional comments)
The review will focus on work quality, attitude,attendance, team work and more.

please assist should you be raeding this. I have covered all the front end part.
